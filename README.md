Swipe swipe mania is an Android phone rhythm game based on swiping.
Created in about 4 weeks as half way through another project got cancelled.

Some interesting information about this is that it uses Stepmania of Dance Dance Revolution files to load songs.
It will keep the music in sync with the stepfile by polling the sampletime of the music player.
